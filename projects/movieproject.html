            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>After learning a lot about CSS and HTML, we were tasked by our 10th grade SEP teacher, Mr Mueller,
            to use everything we learned to work with a partner to make a webpage for a madeup movie
            too test how well we could use the many different elements. This project had lots of freedom when
            it came to how the project looked and what it was about and only limited us to how much of each element we needed.</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p> Me and my partner decided on a project revolving around the idea of fantasy and magic. Although the main idea was to make a movie webpage, 
            we also needed to have a planning page to understand what was too be done and by who which suprisingly helped quite a lot as we could also
            use that same planning page to talk with one another. </p>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>Most of the project was quite simple because we didn't really run into any conflicts involving the code especially since my partner could help with anything I didnt know
            , vice versa and I also had my trusty notes. The issue would later be shown when we came to using images, the images itself were fine but with how the formatting and the
            coding site itself worked, we were having issues having the images in the right place even with tools such as float, margin and padding. We were able to solve this later 
            on with some testing around the images and just trying differnt things when this specific position wasn't working  out but then we learnt that in differnt zooms and even 
            fullscreen preview, the image layout was significantly off and we never acutally fixed this problem but was reassured that we would learn how to fix this issue in later 
            units and wouldn't affect our grades.</p>
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>Some takeaways coming from this project is that its okay to be curious espeically when it comes to coding. Coding is a very complicated thing and has a lot of differnt 
            ways it can be utilized. This project had me wondering about the formatting and how do coders make their website look so organized and neat especially the images. Learning 
            we were gonna learn how to do this ourselves was somewhat relieving and this project and previous lessons that required image or text formatting was very annoying to do.</p>
            <h2>Next Step</h2>
            <p>Although Im not sure if were ever going to come back to the project, I do believe it was well done and I've learned quite a bit becuase of my partner, for instance,
                I didnt know how to use gradient yet they were able to implement it and it actually looked prety nice. Like stated in takeaway, 
                because we are learning to better format the slides, I would like to come back and use our images more efficently as curretly they are just isolated by themselves under our text.</p>
